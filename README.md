## About the Project  

Our goal is to demonstrate that math can solve real-world problems, not just theoretical ones, and to show how math is used in machine learning through AI.  

While our solution focuses on math and machine learning, it can be extended to other subjects.

## Key Features  

Our solution revolves around **live, interactive experiments** with a gamification element.  
- **Teachers** can create lessons (AI-generated with optional edits) and attach experiments to them.  
- **Students** can engage with interactive experiments that help them visualize concepts and solve problems.  

### Experiments  

#### 1. **Optimizing the Surface Area of a Soda Can**  
- **Problem**: Help a soda company minimize the surface area of a 330 mL can.  
- **Interactivity**:  
  - Students interact with a 3D can, adjusting height and radius.  
  - They observe how these parameters affect volume and surface area.  
  - The visualization emphasizes parameter correlations rather than finding optimal values.  
- **Objective**:  
  - Discover real-world applications of derivatives.  
  - Compute optimum values and submit them to advance.  

#### 2. **Customer Clustering for Marketing**  
- **Problem**: Classify a companyâ€™s 30 clients into three categories based on "Age" (X-axis) and "Annual Salary" (Y-axis).  
- **Interactivity**:  
  - Students manually assign clusters to plotted points.  
  - They verify their results against the KMeans clustering model.  
- **Objective**:  
  - Understand KMeans clustering.  
  - Achieve at least 60% accuracy to progress.  

#### 3. **Building a Neural Network to Classify Heights**  
- **Problem**: Classify people into height categories based on features like age, gender, parental height average, nutrition score, and physical activity level.  
  - Class 0: Height < 170 cm  
  - Class 1: Height 170â€“185 cm  
  - Class 2: Height > 185 cm  
- **Interactivity**:  
  - Visualize and customize a neural network.  
  - Explore data via meaningful plots before training the model.  
  - Adjust hidden layers, activation functions, and optimizers.  
- **Objective**:  
  - Learn how artificial neural networks work and fine-tune a simple model.

## How We Used AI  

1. **Chatbots**:  
   Each experiment features a chatbot to guide students.  
   - The chatbot has contextual knowledge.  
   - Students can ask questions like "Explain me how to do this."  

2. **Lesson Generation**:  
   Teachers can generate lessons by entering keywords.  
   - Output is in LaTeX format for easy editing.  

---

## Future Opportunities  

1. **Speech-to-Text for Students**  
   - Enable voice interactions instead of text prompts.  

2. **Recommendation System for Teachers**  
   - Suggest relevant experiments for specific lessons.
